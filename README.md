# Babbel project
The **Babbel** project was my final **C#** Winform test. It's an application that has multiple exercices to learn spanish, all stored in a database.

## How to use

You can find the executable version (**.exe**) in bin/Debug.
>Download **"La Casa de Babbel.exe"** and put it in a new folder.
>Download the **"Base"** folder and put it in too.

Launch the **.exe** and enjoy !
